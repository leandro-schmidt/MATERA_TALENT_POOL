# MATERA_TALENT_POOL
Rest Server for the matera talent pool evaluation.
The project consists into a web application that exposes REST operations for employees.
A more detailed documentation about the operations can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/leandro-schmidt/MATERA_TALENT_POOL/1.0.0)

## Getting Started
Here are a few things you need to know about this application.

### Initial Employee Data
When the application is started, it will use the json file located [here](https://github.com/leandro-schmidt/MATERA_TALENT_POOL/blob/master/src/main/resources/employees.json) as a initial load of employees to the memory database. 
If you want to add more employees, or remove some, change this file and then build the application again.

## Building and Running
Since this application uses Spring Boot and Maven, you just need to build it with this command from the root directory:
```
mvn clean install
```
A jar will be generated in the target directory.

The jar can be executed with the following command:
```
java -jar MATERA_TALENT_POOL-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Other important info
Here are some useful info.

### Json Examples
In the [resources](https://github.com/leandro-schmidt/MATERA_TALENT_POOL/blob/master/src/main/resources) directory there are two json files that are examples of the ones used in the post requests.

### Using the login operation
Since this is not a real application, tokens can be generated by passing 'admin' as username and 'password' as password when calling the login operation.
